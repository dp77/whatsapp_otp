# Whatsapp OTP Sender & Crypto Coin Data Plugin

Welcome to the Whatsapp OTP Sender & Crypto Coin Data Plugin! This Flutter package allows you to send OTPs via WhatsApp and fetch cryptocurrency data easily within your Flutter applications.

## Installation

To use this package, add `whatsapp_otp` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whatsapp_otp: ^0.1.0 # Check for latest version on pub.dev

## Usage

### Sending OTPs via WhatsApp

To send an OTP via WhatsApp, simply call the `sendOTP` function provided by the package and provide the recipient's phone number along with the OTP.

```dart
import 'package:whatsapp_otp/whatsapp_otp.dart';

// Inside your function or wherever needed
void sendOTP() {
  String recipientNumber = '+1234567890'; // Phone number to receive OTP
  String otp = '1234'; // OTP to send
  
  WhatsappOTPSender.sendOTP(recipientNumber, otp);
}
```

### Fetching Crypto Coin Data

To fetch cryptocurrency data, use the `fetchCryptoData` function provided by the package. This function returns a `CryptoData` object containing relevant information about the requested cryptocurrency.

```dart
import 'package:whatsapp_otp/whatsapp_otp.dart';

// Inside your async function or wherever needed
void fetchCrypto() async {
  String cryptoSymbol = 'BTC'; // Cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH, etc.)
  
  CryptoData cryptoData = await WhatsappOTPSender.fetchCryptoData(cryptoSymbol);
  
  // Accessing crypto data
  print('Crypto Name: ${cryptoData.name}');
  print('Current Price: ${cryptoData.price}');
  print('Market Cap: ${cryptoData.marketCap}');
  // Add more fields as needed
}
```
